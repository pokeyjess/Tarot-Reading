# Tarot card reading

## Let the computer pick your cards!

This simple program uses JavaScript to generate a random number, which is then used to select a card from an array.

On the main page, the idea is to select one card, which would be the user's Tarot for the day. A second page offers a more detailed reading, in the format of a "Celtic Cross," a popular layout.

Since the program is designed for those already familiar with the Tarot, explainations of individual cards is not included. That could always be expanded on in the future.

For now, it is just a simple application designed to generate a random Tarot reading.

## Credits

Images were taken from the Rider-Waite deck, also known as the Waite-Smith deck, arguably the most recognized Tarot rendition. Originally published 1909, the cards were drawn by Pamela Colman Smith with guidance from mystic Arthur Edward Waite.

The cards themselves are no longer under copyright. However, I will credit Tarot expert Holly Voley for making these particular scans available, in the public domain, for downloading at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider-Waite_tarot_deck
