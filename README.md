## Let the computer pick your cards!

This simple program uses JavaScript to generate a random number, which is then used to select a card from an array.

On the main page, the idea is to select one card, which would be the user's Tarot for the day. A second page offers a more detailed reading, in the format of a "Celtic Cross," a popular layout.

Since the program is designed for those already familiar with the Tarot, explainations of individual cards is not included. That could always be expanded on in the future.

Plans are in the works to create a more mobile-friendly experience, especially for the full reading page. Stay tuned!

For now, this is just a simple application designed to generate a random Tarot reading.
